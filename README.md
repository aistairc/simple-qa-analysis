# simple-qa-analysis
Codes for reproducing the results shown in "An empirical analysis of existing systems and datasets toward general simple question answering" at COLING2020.

All codes and data will be prepared by just running `setup.sh`.
You can find launch scripts for each system in `/scripts`, and revised codes for each system in `/diff`.

## dependencies
python>3.6, virtualenv, and see `/req` for details.

## how to use
### to prepare QAKB systems and datasets
```
$ sh setup.sh
```
### run QAKB systems
```
$ cd scripts;sh run_{bubo|kbqa|keqa}.sh
```
Change $TARGET and $DATA in each script for your purpose.

## datasets
Free917, FreebaseQA, SimpleQuestions, and WebQSP will be prepared by `setup.sh`.

Filtered datasets for simple question answering, F917, FBQ, SQ, and WQ, can be found in `/datasets`.
